# swish 
Case study for games collection and wishlist library, mainly focused on Nintendo Switch.

## About
My friends and I enjoy buying physical copies of Nintendo Switch games for certain games we really love. Sometimes it can be problematic when a game has a limited release, or when we forget that we own a game on multiple platforms.
This is a web app that let's you maintain a record of your gaming collection and add items to your wishlist so you can keep track of the ones you're still missing from your collection.

## Technologies Used
This was built in Java with Spring Boot framework and utilized Thymeleaf to create dynamic webpages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Project Features
User is able to view the list of games, but must be registered to add to library or wishlist. After registration / logging in, they may also view their profile to see their personal library and wishlist.
